# Dressage Unicorn Alternative Controller

**Group:** Grey Assi & Celine Nakpil

- Controller manufacture: Grey
- Code + protoboard/circuitry: Celine

**Timeline:** ? - 05 April 2023

**Task:** Make a controller that doesn't look like a controller that has three keyboard inputs: 'x', left arrow, and right arrow. The controller should be usable for any sort of game that uses those inputs.

**Solution:** Since we do not know what kind of game we are going to test with, we grabbed whatever we had lying around at the time (glittery horse hooves made from cardboard and hot glue) and decided to make a controller themed via the possible interactions of dressage horse prancing and unicorns.

### Materials
